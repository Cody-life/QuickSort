The project is a Java application that visualizes the QuickSort algorithm using a graphical interface. 
It includes a QuickSortVisualizer class to render an array as bars on a panel, updating the visualization with each significant step of the sorting process. The QuickSort class implements the QuickSort algorithm and interacts with the visualizer to display the sorting progress. 
The QuickSortApp class sets up the JFrame and initiates the sorting, providing a real-time visual representation of the QuickSort algorithm in action.
